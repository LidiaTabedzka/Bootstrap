# first-project
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to install Git on my local computer, create an account on Github, push any project from local repository to Github and add Grunt tusk runner to this project.

Within Grunt task runner I added the following plugins: 

-grunt-sass (modyfied to compile scss files into css files),

-grunt-contrib-imagemin,

-grunt-contrib-watch,

-grunt-browser-sync.

The project used to create the first repository was a simple website showing the possibilies of Bootstrap.
